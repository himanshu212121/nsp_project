    <p class="imp">Voting is when a group of people decide something by saying what they want.
        It can be for electing a leader or representative, passing a law, and other things.
         When people are done voting, the votes are counted (often by machines) and the winner is determined.Voting is a method by which a group, such as a meeting or an electorate,
 can engage for the purpose of making a collective decision or expressing an opinion usually following discussions, debates or election campaigns. Democracies elect holders of high office
 by voting. Residents of a jurisdiction represented by an elected official are called "constituents," and the constituents who choose to cast a ballot for their chosen candidate are 
called "voters." There are different systems for collecting votes, but while many of the systems used in decision-making can also be used as electoral systems, any which cater for 
proportional representation can only be used in elections.In smaller organizations, voting can occur in many different ways. Formally via ballot to elect others for example within a 
workplace, to elect members of political associations or to choose roles for others. Informally voting could occur as a spoken agreement or as a verbal gesture like a raised hand or 
electronically.</p>
